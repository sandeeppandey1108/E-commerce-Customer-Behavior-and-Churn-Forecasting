# E-commerce Customer Behavior and Churn Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze E-commerce customer behavior, focusing on identifying patterns related to customer churn, conversion rates, repeat purchases, and cart abandonment. The goal is to build a predictive model that forecasts future customer behavior, allowing businesses to make data-driven decisions that enhance customer retention and satisfaction.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is sourced from the [Kaggle Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 1](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e1), containing anonymized customer data, such as purchase history, customer demographics, and behavior metrics.

Key columns include:
- **Customer ID:** Unique identifier for each customer
- **Purchase Date:** Date of purchase transactions
- **Product Category:** Category of products purchased
- **Total Purchase Amount:** Sum total of purchases made
- **Payment Method, Customer Age, Returns, Churn**: Additional demographic and transactional data

## Installation & Usage
To run this project, you'll need to install the required Python packages. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have `plotly`, `ipywidgets`, and `nbformat>=4.2.0` installed for interactive visualization support.

### Running the Code
You can explore and analyze the data by running the provided Jupyter Notebook `Code.ipynb`:
```bash
jupyter notebook Code.ipynb
```

## Project Structure
- **Code.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling code.
- **data/**: Folder containing the dataset files.
- **README.md**: Project description and guidelines.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python libraries for easy environment setup.

## Approach & Methods
### Data Analysis
This project leverages statistical analysis and visualization to understand customer purchase patterns, identifying trends in:
- Customer churn rates
- Purchase frequency and value segmentation
- Product category preference

### Modeling
We employed several models to predict customer churn:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Trees**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
5. **Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)**

### Results
The final model performance, evaluated on accuracy and recall, provides insights into the likelihood of a customer churning. This helps in identifying high-risk customer segments and tailoring retention strategies effectively.
